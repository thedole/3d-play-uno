**A basic 3d engine reading .obj files**

This repository is about me experimenting with making a 3d-engine of sorts. 
I will not necessarily us commonly accepted techniques that people who 
actually know what they are doing use, partly because I don't have a clue 
about what I'm doing, and partly because half the point is to see what I 
can make more or less intuitively. I will probably try to make it more 
in line with how it should be done when I have tried and failed the 
"intuitive" way, or otherwise feel ready to learn some more.

###Whats done so far
The functionality so far is a very basic model viewer with a fixed "camera" position displaying a wireframe with no backface culling. It has a barebones model reader that can read the .obj model file format. It has no support for textures or normals or other fancy shit, but it works!! :muscle:
